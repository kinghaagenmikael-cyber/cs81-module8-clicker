# Cookie Clicker Reflection

## What helped you understand DOM interaction best?
Seeing how document.getElementById selects elements and updates text in real time helped me understand how JavaScript interacts with the page.

## How did you choose your milestone messages?
I chose messages that felt a bit more fun and encouraging at first, then more humorous as the number of clicks increased.

## What challenge or bug surprised you?
The biggest challenge was making sure the messages only appeared once at the correct click count instead of repeating.

## What personal twist did you add?
I added background color changes at each milestone to make progress more visually noticeable.

## What real-world app uses this kind of interaction?
Many games, fitness apps, and social media platforms use click-based interactions to track progress and reward user engagement so this could add to those interactions.
